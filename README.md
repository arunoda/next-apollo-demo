## Tasks

[x] Fork the repo: https://github.com/arunoda/next-apollo-demo This is a basic app using Next.js &amp; Apollo GraphQL.
[] Update Next.js, React, Apollo GraphQL to the latest versions. 
[] Refactor the code as deemed fit. Brownie points if you use some of the latest features of react like Hooks, Suspense Lazy etc. More brownie points if you use TypeScript. 
[] Create a GraphQL Query and Resolver that will generate a dummy list of about 2000 names with their addresses, email and phone numbers. Feel free to use any fake data generator library, btw love https://www.npmjs.com/package/casual 
[] Create a New Page in Nextjs where you display these names and addresses as a grid of card tiles. The page needs to be responsive. 
[] Implement Lazyloading / Infinite scrolls so that you load 20 cards each time you click a ‘Load More’ button, which you would need to create. 
[] Add Unit Tests using Jest and React Testing Library. 
[] Dockerize the server and client app and use docker-compose so that we can run the app locally using docker-compose. Bonus Task. 

[] Deploy your App on Heroku. And send us a link to the app. 
[] Write cypress end to end test for the page you created.
